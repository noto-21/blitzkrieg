# blitzkrieg
A four-player battle-royale tank game developed using C# with the XNA Framework for a CS class in secondary school, as part of a group project.  Compatible with both Windows OS and the Xbox 360 (untested).  You can only use Xbox controllers to play (and only if you plug them into your PC's USB slot), but K/M support may be incorporated in the future.

*NOTE:* This project requires that you have the XNA Framework installed.  A copy of all files needed to run XNA with VS2019 are included, and alongside an installation guide were found [here](https://flatredball.com/visual-studio-2019-xna-setup/#:~:text=Introduction%201%20Download%20a%20modified%20version%20of%20MXA,XNA%20Game%20Studio%204.0.vsix%20.%20...%20More%20items).  Installing the XNA Framework is the **FIRST** thing you should do before attempting to run the game.

If you are using a newer version of VS, then for the purposes of this project you can find the XNA files needed [over here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27598) and the resources needed to incorporate them [right here](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/migrate_xna.html).

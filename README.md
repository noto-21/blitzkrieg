# blitzkrieg
Blitzkrieg is a four-player battle-royale tank game that was developed for a CS group project in secondary school, using C# and the XNA Framework.  Compatible with both Windows OS and the Xbox 360 (untested).  You can only use Xbox controllers to play (and only if you plug them into your PC's USB slot), but K/M support may be incorporated in the future.

*NOTE:* This project requires that you have the XNA 4.0 Framework installed.  A copy of all files needed to run XNA with VS2019 are included, and alongside an installation guide were found [here](https://flatredball.com/visual-studio-2019-xna-setup/#:~:text=Introduction%201%20Download%20a%20modified%20version%20of%20MXA,XNA%20Game%20Studio%204.0.vsix%20.%20...%20More%20items).  Installing the XNA Framework is the **FIRST** thing you should do before attempting to run the game.

If you are using a newer version of VS, then for the purposes of this project you can find the XNA 4.0 files needed [over here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27598) and the resources needed to incorporate them [right here](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/migrate_xna.html).  

Alternatively, you can consider utilizing the [MonoGame API](https://docs.monogame.net/index.html), a re-implementation of XNA (which has technically been discontinued) that is largely similar to XNA (save for a few [minor differences](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/migrate_xna.html#missingremoved-api)), for Blitzkrieg.  Further documentation regarding migration from XNA 3.1 to 4.0 [is here](https://nelsonhurst.com/xna-cheatsheet/), should you need it for reference.

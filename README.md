# blitzkrieg
A four-player tank game made using C# with the XNA Framework.  Compatible with both Windows OS and the Xbox 360.  You can use K/M or a 360 controller to play.

*NOTE:* This project requires that you have the XNA Framework installed.  As well, you may need to use an older edition of VS to run the game (such as 2015).  Will work on updating the project for modern systems.
